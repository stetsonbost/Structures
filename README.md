# Lots-O-Structures!

For this project I will implement some of the data structures I have learned about from CS70 at HMC and Robert Sedgewick's *Algorithms in C++, Parts 1-4*.
I am starting this project in C++, but I may eventually work with different languages.
This project is only meant as an exercise for myself; I make no promise that all structures are correctly, elegantly or efficiently implemented, but I'll try my best.
Admittedly, I don't like writing tests, so I'm already behind on testing these structures.

I want to be able to add elements, delete elements, and find elements, as well as other functionality that may depend on the type of container.
As a secondary goal, I want to maintain neat, consistent coding style throughout this project, as was enforced in CS70; this means adhering to the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) (more or less).

So far, I've implemented the following data structures:
  * Trees:
    * Basic BST (Unbalanced) - *untested*
  * Doubly-Linked List - *untested*

I'm planning on implementing the following data structures, although not necessarily in the order listed here:
  * Hash Tables with the following collision resolution strategies:
    * Separate Chaining
    * Linear Probing
    * Quadratic Probing
    * Double Hashing
  * Trees:
    * Random BST
    * Randomized BST
    * Splay BST
    * AVL BST
    * 2-3-4 Tree
    * Red-Black BST
  * Heaps:
    * Min heap
    * Max heap
  * Queues:
    * Single-ended
    * Double-ended
  * Stack
  * "Chunky" Container
  * Hexagonal Grid
  * Matrices
