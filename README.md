# Lots-O-Structures!

For this project I will implement some of the data structures I have learned about from CS70 at HMC and Robert Sedgewick's *Algorithms in C++, Parts 1-4*. 
This project is only meant as an exercise for myself; I make no promise that all structures are correctly or efficiently implemented, but I'll try my best.

I want to be able to add elements, delete elements, find elements, and iterate through each container, as well as other functionality.
I'm planning on implementing the following types of data structures:
  * Hash Tables with the following collision resolution strategies:
    * Separate Chaining
    * Linear Probing
    * Quadratic Probing
    * Double Hashing
  * Trees:
    * Basic (Unbalanced) BST
    * Random BST
    * Randomized BST
    * Splay BST
    * AVL BST
    * 2-3-4 Tree
    * Red-Black BST
  * Heaps:
    * Min heap
    * Max heap
  * Linked Lists:
    * Singly-linked
    * Doubly-linked
  * Queues:
    * Single-ended
    * Double-ended
  * Stack
